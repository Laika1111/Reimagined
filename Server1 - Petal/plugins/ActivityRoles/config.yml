# ActivityRoles, (c) Shadow 2022

# This plugin manages syncing between a player's Minecraft playtime and their Discord roles.
# There are two types of syncs:
#   Giving a player a role based on how long they have ever played on the server. (type: "total")
#   Giving a player a role based on how recently they have played on the server. (type: "seen")
#
# You can list times in either minutes, hours, days, or weeks, by using "m", "h", "d", or "w"
#
# NOTE: Offline players will only have their "seen" roles synced, they must be online to have their "total" role synced. This is a MC limitation.
